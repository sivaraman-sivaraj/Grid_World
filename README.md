### User's Attention ####
User needs to declare the goal and sub goal positions and correcposding rewards. For different grid size, it recommanded to change the size in environment file. 
Gym OpenAI platform is used for the environment construction. 


### RL Algorithms ###
1. File 1 - Standard  Value iteration Algorithm and Gaussâ€“Seidel VI algorithm
2. File 2 - Policy Iteration Algorithm
3. others on progess...!
